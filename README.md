# Automatic Snake AI

## Prior Preparation
Programming Language: Python 3.x

Requirement: Numpy, Matplotlib

## Birf Introduction
This project is about a simple snake AI. I just use BFS and wandering to control the snake. You can design safer and more intelligent algorithm to make the score of snake higher.

This is just a projuct to improve my ability of OOP,so I just use one half of an afternoon to finish it by meself. If there are some questions, you can contact me!

## Sub-file Introduction
The snake.py is to define the class Snake.

The food_map.py is to define food class and map class.

The main.py is to show the snake AI, using matplotlib.

The main2.py is to save the .gif file in the document called result_gif.

## Hyper Parameters Introduction
I want to introduce the hyper parameters in main.py merely.

The "H" references to the height of the map.

The "W" references to the width of the map.

The "global_seed" references to the global seed of random module.

You just need to change these 3 hyper parameters to accomplish your automatic snake AI.
